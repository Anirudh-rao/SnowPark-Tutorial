From the above image we see the differnce between snowflake connector and snowpark.

A Simple Query execution background of the Python Connector API is as shown below:

1. The `Snowpark dataframe` took inspiration from `pyspark dataframe` and the `pandas on Snowflake` was from `pandas` api`.

2. The entire `MLLib in Pyspark` stood as an inspiration for `Snowpark ML`.

3. Snowflake changed the syntax from `mixedCase` to `Snake_Case`.
